Hello! I am a Professor at the University of Arizona, exploring the Universe (dark denergy, dark matter, inflation, cosmological tests of gravity) with ground and space-based telescopes: Roman Space Telescope, Rubin Observatory, SPHEREx explorer, Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, and Euclid. I am also very interested in CMBxLSS cross correlations and I like to hiking.
